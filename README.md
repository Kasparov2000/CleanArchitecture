# Clean Architecture

A starting point for Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core. [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) is just the latest in a series of names for the same loosely-coupled, dependency-inverted architecture. You will also find it named [hexagonal](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture), [ports-and-adapters](http://www.dossier-andreas.net/software_architecture/ports_and_adapters.html), or [onion architecture](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/).

This architecture is used in the [DDD Fundamentals course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/fundamentals-domain-driven-design) by [Steve Smith](https://ardalis.com) and [Julie Lerman](https://thedatafarm.com/). Contact Steve's company, [NimblePros](https://nimblepros.com/), for Clean Architecture or DDD training and/or implementation assistance for your team.
# Getting Started

To use this template, there are a few options:

- Install using `dotnet new`

Navigate to the directory where you will put the new solution.

Run this command to create the solution structure in a subfolder name `Your.ProjectName`:

```
dotnet new clean-arch -o Your.ProjectName
```

The `Your.ProjectName` directory and solution file will be created, and inside that will be all of your new solution contents, properly namespaced and ready to run/test!

# Patterns Used

This solution template has code built in to support a few common patterns, especially Domain-Driven Design patterns. Here is a brief overview of how a few of them work.

## Domain Events

Domain events are a great pattern for decoupling a trigger for an operation from its implementation. This is especially useful from within domain entities since the handlers of the events can have dependencies while the entities themselves typically do not. In the sample, you can see this in action with the `ToDoItem.MarkComplete()` method. The following sequence diagram demonstrates how the event and its handler are used when an item is marked complete through a web API endpoint.
